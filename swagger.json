Examples includes 10G, 40G, 100G\n(e.g., 10x10G, 4x25G or 1x100G) and 400G/1T in the future.\nPhysical client ports will have associated operational state or\nPMs.\n\nphysical channel: a physical lane or channel in the\nphysical client port.  Each physical client port has 1 or more\nchannels. An example is 100GBASE-LR4 client physical port having\n4x25G channels. Channels have their own optical PMs and can be\nmonitored independently within a client physical port (e.g.,\nchannel power).  Physical client channels are defined in the\nmodel as part of a physical client port, and are modeled\nprimarily for reading their PMs.\n\nlogical channel: a logical grouping of logical grooming elements\nthat may be assigned to subsequent grooming stages for\nmultiplexing / de-multiplexing, or to an optical channel for\nline side transmission.  The logical channels can represent, for\nexample, an ODU/OTU logical packing of the client\ndata onto the line side.  Tributaries are similarly logical\ngroupings of demand that can be represented in this structure and\nassigned to an optical channel.  Note that different types of\nlogical channels may be present, each with their corresponding\nPMs.\n\noptical channel:  corresponds to an optical carrier and is\nassigned a wavelength/frequency.  Optical channels have PMs\nsuch as power, BER, and operational mode.\n\nDirectionality:\n\nTo maintain simplicity in the model, the configuration is\ndescribed from client-to-line direction.  The assumption is that\nequivalent reverse configuration is implicit, resulting in\nthe same line-to-client configuration.\n\nPhysical layout:\n\nThe model does not assume a particular physical layout of client\nand line ports on the terminal device (e.g., such as number of\nports per linecard, separate linecards for client and line ports,\netc.).,This module defines configuration and operational state data\nfor the LLDP protocol.,This module defines a schema for power supply components in\nthe OpenConfig platform model.,This module contains a set of general type definitions that\nare used across OpenConfig models.

The primary\nrelationship supported by the model is containment, e.g.,\ncomponents containing subcomponents.\n\nIt is expected that this model reflects every field replacable\nunit on the device at a minimum (i.e., additional information\nmay be supplied about non-replacable components).\n\nEvery element in the inventory is termed a 'component' with each\ncomponent expected to have a unique name and type, and optionally\na unique system-assigned identifier and FRU number.  The\nuniqueness is guaranteed by the system within the device.\n\nComponents may have properties defined by the system that are\nmodeled as a list of key-value pairs. These may or may not be\nuser-configurable.  The model provides a flag for the system\nto optionally indicate which properties are user configurable.\n\nEach component also has a list of 'subcomponents' which are\nreferences to other components. Appearance in a list of\nsubcomponents indicates a containment relationship as described\nabove.  For example, a linecard component may have a list of\nreferences to port components that reside on the linecard.\n\nThis schema is generic to allow devices to express their own\nplatform-specific structure.  It may be augmented by additional\ncomponent type-specific schemas that provide a common structure\nfor well-known component types.  In these cases, the system is\nexpected to populate the common component schema, and may\noptionally also represent the component and its properties in the\ngeneric structure.\n\nThe properties for each component may include dynamic values,\ne.g., in the 'state' part of the schema.  For example, a CPU\ncomponent may report its utilization, temperature, or other\nphysical properties.  The intent is to capture all platform-\nspecific physical data in one location, including inventory\n(presence or absence of a component) and state (physical\nattributes or status).,This module adds
